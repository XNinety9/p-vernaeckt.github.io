## Behind X99

I live in Bordeaux, France, with my lovely wife, our son and our cats.

I am a PhD student, working in the field of data privacy in trigger-action platforms.

Beyond this, I am passionnate about everything that moves electrons. More precisely, I love dev (C/C++ mainly, but also in Python, Js, bash...), building electronics stuff, IoT, sys admin and many more.

I also play bass and practice martial arts.
